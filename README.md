# mines-rs
Minesweeper clone written in Rust. Port of [colleen05/raylib-mines](https://github.com/colleen05/raylib-mines) using [Macroquad](https://macroquad.rs/).

## :warning: :rotating_light: BAD PORT :rotating_light: :warning:
This project is not meant to reflect good Rust practices. It is a more "literal" translation of the aforementioned raylib-miens project. The code is still littered with C paradigms that have been forced to work in Rust.
